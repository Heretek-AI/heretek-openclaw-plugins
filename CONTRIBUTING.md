feature/add-new-skill
fix/gateway-memory-leak
docs/update-api-reference
refactor/improve-error-handling
```

### Making Commits

1. **Create a branch** from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make focused commits**
   - Each commit should do one thing
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Test before committing

3. **Keep your branch updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

## Pull Requests

- **What** changes are being made
- **Why** the changes are needed
- **How** the changes were tested
- **Related issues** (if any)

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Address feedback** promptly
4. **Squash commits** if requested

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when fixing bugs
- Aim for meaningful coverage
- Test edge cases

### Test Types

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | Test individual functions |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | Test component interactions |
| E2E | `tests/e2e/` | Test full user flows |
| Skills | `tests/skills/` | Test skill execution |

## Code Style

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate agent health status
 * @param {Object} agent - Agent instance
 * @returns {Object} Health status
 */
function calculateHealth(agent) {
  const metrics = collectMetrics(agent);
  return {
    status: metrics.status,
    score: metrics.score
  };
}
```

### Formatting

- Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```
